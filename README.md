# Colombian-Minimum-Wage-Analysis-and-Visualization

This project hopes to discover how the colombian minimum wage has behaved in regards to the US Dollar to Colombian Peso exchange rate. Colombian minimum wage has increased since 1984 up to 2022, but the value of Colombian Pesos in relation to US Dollars has had a more volatile behaviour, but in general it has had an upwards trend. 

Here we discover that while Colombian minimum wage has only increased, since its increase has been measured in Colombian Pesos, when converted to US Dollars with the exchange rate equivalent to each year; it is shown that ,relative to us Dollars, Colombian minimum wage has decreased in some years and the purchasing power of Colombians has not behaved proportionately to the apparent increases in minimum wage.
